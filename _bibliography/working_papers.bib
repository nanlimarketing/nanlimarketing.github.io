    abstract = {Firms increasingly leverage "influencers" who promote products by posting social media content such as videos. For entertainment products like books, movies, television, and video games, influencers collect revenue from the social media platform even when showing copyrighted content, creating potential cross-incentives. Whether the firm benefits depends on whether such posted contents are complements or substitutes to the firm's original good. Using a large daily panel data set on thousands of video games and leveraging a supply shock on YouTube called the "Adpocalypse", we measure the impact of influencer videos on games. We provide evidence that on average influencer video posts are complementary to entertainment products for both purchases and usage, serving as free advertising. However, we find heterogeneous effects that imply firms need to align their policies on IP protection and revenue models with the spillovers for their games. Some games experience substitutes in purchases, requiring the firm to rely on subscription and in-game revenues or to protect their game content. Our results also speak to open legal questions about the application of the "fair use" doctrine to this setting. Finally, we extend our main analyses to provide new insights into influencer marketing strategies.},

    abstract = {From taking inspiration to outright copying, new apps are frequently developed using the ideas of successful competitors.  Mobile app platforms (markets), such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, have policies intended to screen these "copycat'' apps.     We study the effect these "copycat'' apps have on incumbents by leveraging data from multiple Android app markets in China.   We identify which apps copied others using a supervised machine-learning approach. Our identification strategy leverages the fact that we observe the same app competing against different competitors on different platforms. We find that on average copycats do not reduce the demand for incumbent apps.  However, moderators of this effect show that the largest and most highly rated apps are harmed by the presence of copycats. Furthermore, copycats cause developers of incumbent apps to behave differently.  Higher-quality incumbents change their descriptions to differentiate themselves from low-quality copycats. Our results show that the filtering of copycat apps does not confer significant benefits to app developers, which may inform recent discussions on the value that app platforms provide.},
