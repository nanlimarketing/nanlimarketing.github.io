    abstract = {We study platform information design, in which a platform provides information about individual consumer preferences, and sellers use the information to set targeted prices. Because targeting might intensify competition within narrow markets, what information should be provided to improve sellers' profits remains an empirical question. Using unique individual-level purchase and usage data on Steam, we estimate a two-stage consumer choice model to recover heterogeneous preferences for video games. Then, we simulate and compare across a comprehensive set of counterfactual targeted price equilibria, where sellers are given no, full, or partial information about individual consumer types through (coarsened) segmentation. Our results show that the platform can maximize sellers' total profits without providing full information, achieving a $71.9 million annual profit gain. Moreover, a coarsened, two-segment design can already achieve a $55.7 million profit gain by revealing the aspect of heterogeneity that leads to market expansion while concealing the aspects that lead to intensified competition.},

    abstract = {From taking inspiration to outright copying, new apps are frequently developed using the ideas of successful competitors.  Mobile app platforms (markets), such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, have policies intended to screen these "copycat'' apps.     We study the effect these "copycat'' apps have on incumbents by leveraging data from multiple Android app markets in China.   We identify which apps copied others using a supervised machine-learning approach. Our identification strategy leverages the fact that we observe the same app competing against different competitors on different platforms. We find that on average copycats do not reduce the demand for incumbent apps.  However, moderators of this effect show that the largest and most highly rated apps are harmed by the presence of copycats. Furthermore, copycats cause developers of incumbent apps to behave differently.  Higher-quality incumbents change their descriptions to differentiate themselves from low-quality copycats. Our results show that the filtering of copycat apps does not confer significant benefits to app developers, which may inform recent discussions on the value that app platforms provide.},
